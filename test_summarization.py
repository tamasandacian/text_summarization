                         "was such that northern English clubs began offering them professional terms to move south. At first, the FA "\

                         "overtaken cricket as England's national sport by the early 20th century. The size of the Football League increased "\
                         "from the original twelve clubs in 1888 to 92 in 1950. The clubs were organised by team merit in four divisions with "\
                         "promotion and relegation atthe end of each season. Internationally, England hosted and won the 1966 FIFA World Cup "\
                         "but has otherwise been among the also-rans in global terms. English clubs have been a strong presence in European "\
